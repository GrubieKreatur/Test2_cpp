## Overview

TicTacToe_cpp is a C++ project designed to demonstrate core algorithmic concepts and graphics integration. The project primarily implements a minimax algorithm to address decision-making problems and utilizes the SFML library for multimedia and graphical functionalities. This project serves as a foundation for exploring game logic, AI strategies, and real-time graphics in C++.

## Features
The project features several distinct game modes, allowing players to choose the style of play that best suits them:

- **Human vs. Human:**  
  Two players take turns playing on the same computer. This mode is ideal for local multiplayer sessions where players can directly compete against each other.

- **Human vs. Computer:**  
  In this mode, the player faces off against an AI opponent. Play against the computer at various difficulty settings.
   - **Easy Bot Player**: A bot with random decision-making capabilities.
  - **Normal Bot Player**: A bot with basic strategies.
  - **Hard Bot Player**: A bot with advanced tactics for challenging gameplay.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Enjoy a visual representation of the game board and interactions.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have a C++17 compatible compiler.
- **SFML Library**: The project utilizes the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) for graphics rendering.

## Precompiled Version

If you don't want to compile the project yourself, a precompiled version is available as a ZIP archive named TicTacToe.zip. This version is only available for Windows. You can simply download and extract it to play the game without additional setup.

## Usage

- Upon launching the game, use the main menu to select the desired game mode.
- Follow on-screen prompts to play the game.
- Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Third-Party Contributions

This project was built with the assistance of several external resources:
